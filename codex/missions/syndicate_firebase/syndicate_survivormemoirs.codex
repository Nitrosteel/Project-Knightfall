    "'To survive, is to choose.'

That's what the Red Blades told us when we got conscripted; That it was either me or my sister, which wasn't really a choice. I'd rather have her work in the mines.

I didn't think much of the expression. It was just some quote Father and the cartels followed. You could see it plastered like propaganda wherever you go. In fact, the only place you don't see that quote is on the crates we loot from Knightfall.",

"Conscription wasn't so bad at first. I was on lookout duty for hours on end. You were lucky if you were assigned a tower, because the screams of agony from the pens seemed more distant from an elevated position. The rest was like clockwork: Get up early enough, and you won't get yelled at.

I wish it lasted longer than it did.

Things didn't fall apart all at once. It started with an acid storm that burned through our fields in a single night.",

"We still had food in the storehouses, but quota was due the next morning, so it all went away. Try scrubbing acid puddles on an empty stomach, and see how long before your hands give out.

Then the shells stopped coming. I heard whispers that Knightfall was cracking down on our routes. Maybe it was true, maybe it wasn't. Either way, we tried raiding one of their depots to make up the loss, and that cost us five buggies in a single day.

The storms didn't stop, and the",

"sickness followed. Disease crawled through the mines, and slaves started dying faster than we could bury them. A month later, half our numbers were gone. Quotas slipped. Everyone knew it was only a matter of time before someone paid the price.

Through it all, the Overseer never left his hut, drowning in liquor while the rest of us starved. We thought he had given up. Who wouldn't? Most of us already had.

Then, one day, a ship arrived. A small",

"gunship, crimson all over with black stripes adorning its wings and cockpit. It was unlike any Syndicate ship we've seen before, and utterly pretentious (even when compared to Knightfall ships). At its sides were the mark of the Father, a golden skull framed within a football-shaped ellipse. We knew it was a Red Blade.

They ran past the guards and gunned straight for the Overseer's hut. Before long, we were gathered in the square with the Overseer in the middle, stripped naked, blindfolded,", 

"and hands tied. The Red Blade's katana gleamed in the light.

'All of you have a choice to follow. Father has chosen all of you to live. It is your choice to serve, or to fail.'

With one swipe, the Overseer was bisected. Straight across the middle. It was a gruesome sight, and it only shook those of us who tried to remain unmoved. 

Afterwards, the Red Blade left.",

"No further orders were given, no decrees from Father, no promise of supplies... but we understood the message.

I had to do it. I needed to do it. I had to step up because I knew this was just going to keep happening if I didn't.

The first days were the longest. Managing morale was a pain in the ass. Guns were drawn, and shots were fired. Whips were cracked. The arrogant ones had to go.",

"Having a few friends in the right places made a lot of transitions a lot smoother. But beyond that, I don't know what compelled me to do it. Perhaps the prospect of being split in half was all the motivation I needed.

You learn quickly that when you're out of options, you still find ways to make a few out of nothing.

Decent artillery shells aren't made out of powder and buckets, but if it explodes anywhere other than in your face, it works.",

"Snails and sawdust start sounding like a good meal. And you learn that flaying works better than whipping. 

But you know what's the worst part? Meeting a quota with no promise of supplies. Maybe that's why my predecessor gave up.

I won't be like that. I can't. Not for my sister.

And I'll carve that choice into my own men.",

"\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been thinking about that quote a lot.
