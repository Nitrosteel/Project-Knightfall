    "^red;It's too late for me^reset;

If you're reading this, then welcome to the shithole that will be your life from now on. You didn't ask for this, and neither did I, but fate is unkind and these are the cards we've been dealt.

I've been here too long. Far too long to remember what's healthy, but long enough to know that I was lucky. So I've made this guide, in the hopes that some fortunate soul finds it, uses it, and passes it on.",

"May it ease their burdens as it did my guilt.

Forget about your old life. Or rather don't, cling to it. Maybe it gives you hope. Doesn't matter, you must accept the present.

You're a tool now; They'll stop caring once you stop being useful; And what matters now is your survival. This list will buy you time to hopefully get out.",

"^red;1. SAVE A MAGAZINE^reset;
- Steal one if you have too, but make sure it's full of bullets. This will be important later, I promise you.

^red;2. DO YOUR TASKS^reset;
- If they asked you to put a bullet in a child or clean a pigsty full of shit, you do it. Don't give them a reason to break you. You can shed tears later.

^red;3. DON'T STAND OUT^reset;
- Work at their pace. Don't look them in the eye, and don't speak unless spoken too. A rebel is easier to handle",

"than a threat.

^red;4. OBSERVE^reset;
- Enforcers are lazy. Learn their shift rotations. They change out every 8 hours, and for 10 minutes, you get your reprieve.

^red;5. THE OLD ONES ARE YOUR FRIENDS^reset;
- The young ones are always looking to get out any way they can. They'll sell you out if an opportunity presents itself.",

"^red;6. FOLLOW THEIR LEAD^reset;
- The old ones know the routine. If you see them flinch, be careful. They've been here long enough to know what to avoid.

^red;7. FOOD IS FAVORS^reset;
- You get rations every day. It's shit, but it's better than wood chips. Stash leftovers. You'll need them to ask for favors.

^red;8. THEIR PROMISES ARE EMPTY^reset;
- 'Do this job, and we'll let you go.' Bullshit.",

"- 'One last run, and you're free.' Bullshit.
- 'Father takes care of his own.' Bull. Shit.

^red;9. FIGHT THE URGE^reset;
- If you see a way out, like maybe an open hatch on a smuggler's ship or an open gate... don't take it. Nobody makes it out, no matter how far they go.

^red;10. WAIT^reset;
- It will all go to shit eventually. One way or another, a revolt will pop-up.",

"That's when you make your escape. It may take 5 years, 10 years, maybe 20. But it always happens. And trust me: The cartel or the NPR will be way more lenient. Bring your mags. They'll need every bullet they can get.

I'll be long dead before anyone finds this list. They found a copy of it by the mines. My execution is scheduled.

So it's too late for me.
But you still have time.

Best of luck."
