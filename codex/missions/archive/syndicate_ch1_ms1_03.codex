Receiver: This is 257. You're speaking to Alsel.

^#837b8d;Caller: This is Reznov. Where is my cargo shipment?! You said 3 days! I have customers waiting!^reset;

Receiver: We've used up all the Erchius here trying to fuel your ship. But I just can't send it right now.",

"Receiver: Knightfall ships have been passing through Kesler for the past 2 days.

Receiver: If I send it out now, you'll get nothing but blasted debris.

^#837b8d;Caller: Are you serious right now?! You know they can't hit anything!^reset;

Receiver: With that many guns flying through the system, the math says otherwise.",

"^#837b8d;Caller: ..... ^reset;

^#837b8d;Caller: Alright, how soon can you get that cargo ship launched?^reset;

Receiver: If the fleet maneuvers are finished, I can have it within 3 days.

^#837b8d;Caller: You have 2 days. Keep that ship fueled. I need its engine intact and still ready for the return shipment.^reset;",

"Receiver: Its only got enough fuel for a one-way trip. Do you know how hard it is to mine Erchius? I've lost too many men to ghosts and mutations.

^#837b8d;Caller: I don't care. Use another FTL fuel source then. You have 2 days. Get on it!^reset;
