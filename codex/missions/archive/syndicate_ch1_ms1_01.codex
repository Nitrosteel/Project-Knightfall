    "Six months. That's how long I've been here. It's not clear who the slaves are anymore. We're all just suffering here. I tend to forget why.

I only know that I miss my old life. I miss my family. I miss her. I don't long for anything else these days.

Routines are all the same. We're awoken at gun point. Some are beaten. Others rush to the lockers to avoid this. We grab our equipment before heading to the garage.",

"The guns don't even work properly most of the time; You'd be lucky if they explode and kill you, given all the questionable modifications on these things.

Don't get me started on the armor. You're better off with a jacket.

They drive us to villages to 'collect tribute' and 'enforce mutual peace'. Sometimes it's just a matter of spooking the natives. Other times, it gets violent.",

"The return is the hardest part of the trip. Coming back empty-handed, you'd be the luckiest if you get sentry duty for the day. But for the rest of us? Have fun tending to the pigs, or being stuck in the mines for 8 hours.

When it's all over, you're stripped of your equipment, and you're back to your dusty bunk. By the next dawn, it plays out over and over again.",

"Some grew accustomed to it. Perhaps they find excitement in it. Or perhaps it's better than the lives they had before. Who knows? Who cares?

Some succumb to the insanity; Many of them never talk, only murmur. Eyes all bloodshot or tired, and it feels like I keep seeing red, even when I'm not wearing optics.",

"Today is my day though; Somebody either likes me or hates me, as they left a loaded gun by a crate next to my bunk. It's my ticket to freedom.

I hear frantic running outside and the angry voices accompanying them. Not sure if it has anything to do with me. Can't imagine I mattered much to anyone here beyond annoying them with my gloom.",

"By the time they find this journal, I should be free. I'll see them again when they're all dead. But in the meantime, I'll be with her; I'll finally be happy, once again."
